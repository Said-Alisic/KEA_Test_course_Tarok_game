# KEA_Test_course_Tarok_game
Simple implementation of the Danish Tarok game (which is similar to the French Tarot card game) 
with a java program to use for testing throughout my university "Test" course.
DISCLAIMER: This program does not reflect the exact rules and game logic as 
that is not the goal of making it.
